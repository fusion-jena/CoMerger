This repository dedicated to CoMerger packages, including merger, evaluator, consistency checker, and the online tool’s source code.
It consists of several packages:
* Merger package: It includes a holistic merge method based on the given source ontologies and their mapping. 
* Evaluator package: aim at evaluating the merged ontology based on the source ontologies.
* Consistency checker package: It is based on the subjective logic theory to resolve the inconsistency of the merged ontology with respect to views of source ontologies. 
* Generic Merge Requirements (GMR)s package: It consists of a set of requirements and criteria that a merged ontology expects to achieve. Their implementation and the graph-based compatibility checker between them exist.
* Holistic merge dataset
* Merge evaluation dataset
