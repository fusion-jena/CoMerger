        <rdfs:isDefinedBy>The serine-threonine protein kinase encoded by the AKT1 gene is catalytically inactive in serum-starved primary and immortalized fibroblasts. AKT1 and the related AKT2 are activated by platelet-derived growth factor. The activation is rapid and specific, and it is abrogated by mutations in the pleckstrin homology domain of AKT1. It was shown that the activation occurs through phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. In the developing nervous system AKT is a critical mediator of growth factor-induced neuronal survival. Survival factors can suppress apoptosis in a transcription-independent manner by activating the serine/threonine kinase AKT1, which then phosphorylates and inactivates components of the apoptotic machinery. Mutations in this gene have been associated with the Proteus syndrome. Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants have been found for this gene.

        <rdfs:isDefinedBy>The androgen receptor gene is more than 90 kb long and codes for a protein that has 3 major functional domains: the N-terminal domain, DNA-binding domain, and androgen-binding domain. The protein functions as a steroid-hormone activated transcription factor. Upon binding the hormone ligand, the receptor dissociates from accessory proteins, translocates into the nucleus, dimerizes, and then stimulates transcription of androgen responsive genes. This gene contains 2 polymorphic trinucleotide repeat segments that encode polyglutamine and polyglycine tracts in the N-terminal transactivation domain of its protein. Expansion of the polyglutamine tract from the normal 9-34 repeats to the pathogenic 38-62 repeats causes spinal bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA, also known as Kennedy&apos;s disease). Mutations in this gene are also associated with complete androgen insensitivity (CAIS). Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms.

Additionally, doxorubicin inhibits topoisomerase II which results in an increased and stabilized cleavable enzyme-DNA linked complex during DNA replication and subsequently prevents the ligation of the nucleotide strand after double-strand breakage. Doxorubicin also forms oxygen free radicals resulting in cytotoxicity secondary to lipid peroxidation of cell membrane lipids; the formation of oxygen free radicals also contributes to the toxicity of the anthracycline antibiotics, namely the cardiac and cutaneous vascular effects./NCI-GLOSS Definition: A drug that is used to treat many types of cancer and is being studied in the treatment of other types of cancer.

Both BRCA1 and BRCA2 are involved in maintenance of genome stability, specifically the homologous recombination pathway for double-strand DNA repair. The BRCA2 protein contains several copies of a 70 aa motif called the BRC motif, and these motifs mediate binding to the RAD51 recombinase which functions in DNA repair. BRCA2 is considered a tumor suppressor gene, as tumors with BRCA2 mutations generally exhibit loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of the wild-type allele. [provided by RefSeq, Dec 2008]</rdfs:isDefinedBy>

At 15 and 24 months of follow-up, patients treated with 4 mg zoledronic acid had fewer skeletal-related events(SREs) compared to the placebo group (44% vs. 33%, P = 0.021) and fewer pathological fractures (13.1% vs.22.1%, P = 0.015). Furthermore, the time to first SRE was longer in the zoledronic acid group, thus improving|QoL.|Patients were initially randomised to 4 or 8 mg of zoledronic acid, but the 8 mg dosage|was later modified to 4 mg due to toxicity. The toxicity (e.g., jaw necrosis) of these drugs,especially aminobisphosphonate, must always be kept in mind. Patients should have a dental examination before starting bisphosphonate therapy. The risk of jaw necrosis is increased by a history of trauma, dental|surgery or dental infection, as well as long-term intravenous bisphosphonate administration.No survival benefit has been seen in any prospective trial with bisphosphonates.</rdfs:isDefinedBy>

        <rdfs:isDefinedBy>The Brugada electrocardiogram pattern is characterized by coved-type ST-elevation (&gt;2 mm) in the right precordial leads. We report the case of a 62-year-old man, with bipolar disorder, admitted to the emergency department because of dyspnea and chest discomfort. The patient was on treatment with pregabalin and quetiapine. Unexpectedly, electrocardiogram at admission showed diffuse ST-elevation, more evident in inferior leads, where a Brugada-like pattern was present. The patient underwent coronary angiography with a diagnosis of suspected acute coronary syndrome. Coronary angiography, however, showed mild coronary artery disease not requiring coronary angioplasty. Echocardiography did not reveal left ventricular dysfunction or pericardial effusion. Troponin levels remained normal over serial controls. Eventually, chest radiography showed lung opacities and consolidation suggestive for pneumonia. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first cases showing a transient Brugada-like electrocardiogram pattern in inferior leads, probably amplified by the administration of pregabalin and quetiapine.</rdfs:isDefinedBy>

        <rdfs:isDefinedBy>This gene encodes a member of the cysteine-aspartic acid protease (caspase) family. Sequential activation of caspases plays a central role in the execution-phase of cell apoptosis. Caspases exist as inactive proenzymes composed of a prodomain, a large protease subunit, and a small protease subunit. Activation of caspases requires proteolytic processing at conserved internal aspartic residues to generate a heterodimeric enzyme consisting of the large and small subunits. This protein is involved in the programmed cell death induced by Fas and various apoptotic stimuli. The N-terminal FADD-like death effector domain of this protein suggests that it may interact with Fas-interacting protein FADD. This protein was detected in the insoluble fraction of the affected brain region from Huntington disease patients but not in those from normal controls, which implicated the role in neurodegenerative diseases. Many alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been described, although not all variants have had their full-length sequences determined.

Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants, at least one of which encodes a preproprotein that is proteolytically processed to generate the mature glycoprotein. This calcium-dependent cell-cell adhesion protein is comprised of five extracellular cadherin repeats, a transmembrane region and a highly conserved cytoplasmic tail. Mutations in this gene are correlated with gastric, breast, colorectal, thyroid and ovarian cancer. Loss of function of this gene is thought to contribute to cancer progression by increasing proliferation, invasion, and/or metastasis. The ectodomain of this protein mediates bacterial adhesion to mammalian cells and the cytoplasmic domain is required for internalization. This gene is present in a gene cluster with other members of the cadherin family on chromosome 16. [provided by RefSeq, Nov 2015]</rdfs:isDefinedBy>

        <rdfs:isDefinedBy>In response to DNA damage and replication blocks, cell cycle progression is halted through the control of critical cell cycle regulators. The protein encoded by this gene is a cell cycle checkpoint regulator and putative tumor suppressor. It contains a forkhead-associated protein interaction domain essential for activation in response to DNA damage and is rapidly phosphorylated in response to replication blocks and DNA damage. When activated, the encoded protein is known to inhibit CDC25C phosphatase, preventing entry into mitosis, and has been shown to stabilize the tumor suppressor protein p53, leading to cell cycle arrest in G1. In addition, this protein interacts with and phosphorylates BRCA1, allowing BRCA1 to restore survival after DNA damage. Mutations in this gene have been linked with Li-Fraumeni syndrome, a highly penetrant familial cancer phenotype usually associated with inherited mutations in TP53. Also, mutations in this gene are thought to confer a predisposition to sarcomas, breast cancer, and brain tumors. This nuclear protein is a member of the CDS1 subfamily of serine/threonine protein kinases. Several transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.

        <rdfs:isDefinedBy> An animal sterol found in the body tissues (and blood plasma) of vertebrates. It can be found in large concentrations within the liver, spinal cord, and brain. Cholesterol is an important component of the membranes of cells, providing stability. It is the major precursor for the synthesis of vitamin D, of the various steroid hormones, including cortisol, cortisone, and aldosterone in the adrenal glands, and of the sex hormones progesterone, estrogen, and testosterone. Cholesterol also has an important role for the brain synapses as well as in the immune system. In conditions featuring elevated low density lipoproteins (LDL), cholesterol often forms plaque deposits in the walls of arteries, a condition known as atherosclerosis, which is a major contributor to coronary heart disease and other forms of cardiovascular disease.
CRCH Definition: Lipid composed of 27 carbon atoms which form three fused cycloheane (6-carbon) rings, a cyclopentane (5-carbon ring) and a side chain of 8 carbon atoms. (Ensminger et al).
NCI-GLOSS Definition: A waxy, fat-like substance made in the liver, and found in the blood and in all cells of the body. Cholesterol is important for good health and is needed for making cell walls, tissues, hormones, vitamin D, and bile acid. Cholesterol also comes from eating foods taken from animals such as egg yolks, meat, and whole-milk dairy products. Too much cholesterol in the blood may build up in blood vessel walls, block blood flow to tissues and organs, and increase the risk of developing heart disease and stroke.&quot;</rdfs:isDefinedBy>

Choline helps cells make membranes, make a neurotransmitter (a chemical that helps nerve cells communicate with other cells), and remove fat from the liver. It is found in whole milk, beef liver, eggs, soy foods, and peanuts. Choline is water-soluble (can dissolve in water) and must be taken in every day. Not enough choline can cause diseases of the heart and blood vessels and damage to the liver. A form of choline is being studied in the treatment of some types of cancer and to reduce pain and fever. Choline is also being studied together with vitamin B12 in the prevention and treatment of cancer.</rdfs:isDefinedBy>

Found naturally in animal tissues, cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) is formed in the skin when ultraviolet light activates cholesterol conversion into vitamin D3. Ultraviolet irradiation of ergosterol (plant vitamin D) forms ergocalciferol (vitamin D2). (NCI04)
CRCH Definition: A class of fat-soluble vitamins that are seco-sterol precursors to the active hormone, 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D.
NCI-GLOSS Definition: A nutrient that the body needs in small amounts to function and stay healthy. Vitamin D helps the body use calcium and phosphorus to make strong bones and teeth. It is fat-soluble (can dissolve in fats and oils) and is found in fatty fish, egg yolks, and dairy products. Skin exposed to sunshine can also make vitamin D. Not enough vitamin D can cause a bone disease called rickets. It is being studied in the prevention and treatment of some types of cancer.&quot;</rdfs:isDefinedBy>

        <rdfs:isDefinedBy>A natural fat-soluble antioxidant with potential chemopreventive activity. Also known as tocopherol, vitamin E ameliorates free-radical damage to biological membranes, protecting polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) within membrane phospholipids and within circulating lipoproteins.

CRCH Definition: A fat-soluble vitamin which is primarily a chain-breaking antioxidant that prevents the propagation of lipid peroxidation.
NCI-GLOSS Definition: A nutrient that the body needs in small amounts to function and stay healthy. Vitamin E helps prevent cell damage caused by free radicals (highly reactive chemicals). It is fat-soluble (can dissolve in fats and oils) and is found in seeds, nuts, leafy vegetables, and vegetable oils. Not enough vitamin E can result in infertility (the inability to produce children). It is being studied in the prevention and treatment of some types of cancer.

        <rdfs:isDefinedBy>This gene encodes a member of the Eph receptor family of receptor tyrosine kinase transmembrane glycoproteins. These receptors are composed of an N-terminal glycosylated ligand-binding domain, a transmembrane region and an intracellular kinase domain. They bind ligands called ephrins and are involved in diverse cellular processes including motility, division, and differentiation. A distinguishing characteristic of Eph-ephrin signaling is that both receptors and ligands are competent to transduce a signaling cascade, resulting in bidirectional signaling. This protein belongs to a subgroup of the Eph receptors called EphB. Proteins of this subgroup are distinguished from other members of the family by sequence homology and preferential binding affinity for membrane-bound ephrin-B ligands. Allelic variants are associated with prostate and brain cancer susceptibility. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, May 2015]</rdfs:isDefinedBy>

        <rdfs:isDefinedBy>With a median age at diagnosis of 68 years, PCa is generally a disease of men aged &gt; 70 years. In the USA, the increase in men aged &gt; 65 years will result in an estimated 70% increase in annual diagnosis of PCa by 2030. A similar increase is expected in Europe. The Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database shows that 71% of PCa-related deaths occur in men aged &gt; 75 years, probably due to the higher incidence of advanced/metastatic disease. Despite the high incidence and mortality rates in senior adults, they may be undertreated in the USA and Europe. In the USA, only 41% of patients aged &gt; 75 years with intermediate- and high-risk disease receive curative treatment compared to 88% aged 65-74. Two large studies showed that PCa-specific mortality was low for localised low- and intermediate-risk PCa, irrespective of age. In contrast, cancer-related mortality of up to 64% was found for high-risk PCa.</rdfs:isDefinedBy>

In the radiotherapy group, urinary incontinence was reported to be at its worst by 2 months after surgery, but the effects of EBRT on urinary symptoms had resolved at 12 months and improved over baseline at 24 months [639]. Patients in the LDR brachytherapy group reported significant detriments in urinary irritation or obstruction and incontinence. At 1-2 years after LDR brachytherapy, incontinence was reported by 4-6% of patients. Eighteen percent of the LDR brachytherapy group and 11% of the EBRT group reported distress from overall urinary symptoms at 1 year.</rdfs:isDefinedBy>

        <rdfs:isDefinedBy>ost-diagnostic fat intake was assessed using a validated food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) administered between 1997 and 2001 (11). Men were asked to report their usual intake of 61 foods and beverages over the previous year in nine frequency categories ranging from never or &lt;1/month to 6+/day. A common portion size was specified for each food item (e.g. 1 ounce of nuts). Nutrient data came from the US Department of Agriculture. Intakes of each of the fats of interest were calculated by multiplying the amount of each type of fat in the specified portion size of a food item by the frequency of intake of that food item and summing across all foods. To calculate animal fat, total fat in the specified portion size of each food item from animal sources was multiplied by the frequency of intake for each item and summed across all food items. To calculate vegetable fat, total fat in the specified portion size of food items from vegetable sources was multipled by the frequency of intake of each item and summed across all food items. For food items with both animal and vegetable components (e.g., mashed potatoes, pizza, etc.), the fat content from animal and vegetable sources was determined based on a standard recipe. We multiplied intake of each of the fats (g/d) by 9 kcal and divided by total calories per day to calculate the percent of daily calories from each of the fats of interest.</rdfs:isDefinedBy>

        <rdfs:isDefinedBy>During the past two decades, there has been a trend towards earlier diagnosis of PCa as a result of greater public and professional awareness, leading to the adoption of both formal and informal screening strategies. The effect of this has been to identify men at an earlier stage with smaller tumours that occupy only 5-10% of the prostate volume, with a greater propensity for unifocal or unilateral disease. Most focal therapies to date have been achieved with ablative technologies: cryotherapy, HIFU or photodynamic therapy, electroporation, focal radiotherapy by brachytherapy, or CyberKnife Robotic Radiosurgery System technology (Accuray Inc., Sunnyvale, CA, USA). The main purpose of focal therapy is to limit treatment toxicity in patients that could benefit from local disease control.</rdfs:isDefinedBy>

The RNA can be directly functional or be the intermediate template for a protein that performs a function. The transmission of genes to an organism&apos;s offspring is the basis of the inheritance of phenotypic traits. These genes make up different DNA sequences called genotypes. Genotypes along with environmental and developmental factors determine what the phenotypes will be. Most biological traits are under the influence of polygenes (many different genes) as well as gene–environment interactions. Some genetic traits are instantly visible, such as eye color or number of limbs, and some are not, such as blood type, risk for specific diseases, or the thousands of basic biochemical processes that constitute life.</rdfs:isDefinedBy>

        <rdfs:isDefinedBy>Hyperfunction of the parathyroid glands resulting in the overproduction of parathyroid hormone.

It is associated with hypercalcemia and hypophosphatemia. Signs and symptoms include weakness, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, constipation, depression, bone pain, osteoporosis, cystic bone lesions, and kidney stones. Secondary hyperparathyroidism is caused by the chronic stimulation of the parathyroid glands in patients with chronic renal failure, rickets, and malabsorption syndromes.
NCI-GLOSS Definition: A condition in which the parathyroid gland (one of four pea-sized organs found on the thyroid) makes too much parathyroid hormone. This causes a loss of calcium from the bones and an increased level of calcium in the blood. Symptoms include bone pain and kidney problems.
CTCAE Definition: A disorder characterized by an increase in production of parathyroid hormone by the parathyroid glands. This results in hypercalcemia (abnormally high levels of calcium in the blood).
NICHD Definition: Elevated concentration of parathyroid hormone. Causes include conditions originating within the parathyroid glands (primary), in response to hypocalcemia and hyperphosphatemia (secondary), and renal disease (tertiary). Characteristics may include polyuria, polydipsia, constipation, lethargy, cognitive dysfunction, hypercalciuria, nephrolithiasis, and bone demineralization or reduced bone mineral density.&quot;</rdfs:isDefinedBy>

In addition to a central role in atopy and allergic responses, it has been speculated that IgE-mediated mast cell degranulation, by its release of mediators that increase vascular permeability, has an important role in the initiation of immune response in general.</rdfs:isDefinedBy>

        <rdfs:isDefinedBy>There is no discussion regarding the introduction of IAD in symptomatic patients. However, there is still controversy concerning the best time to introduce hormonal therapy in asymptomatic metastatic patients due to the lack of properly conducted RCTs. These are underpowered trials with heterogeneous patient enrolment(i.e. locally advanced, M1a, M1b status) and variations in ADT modalities and follow-up schedules.ADT was shown to be the most cost-effective therapy if started at the time the patient developed symptomatic metastases. The Cochrane Library review extracted four good-quality RCTs: VACURG I and II trials, the MRC trial, and the ECOG 7887 study. These studies were all conducted in the pre-PSA era and included patientswith advanced PCa, who had received early vs. deferred ADT, either as primary therapy or adjuvant to radical prostatectomy. The Cochrane review found that the M1a/b population showed no improvement in OS,although early ADT significantly reduced disease progression and complication rates due to progression. Based on a systematic review of the literature, the ASCO guidelines on initial hormonal treatment for androgen-sensitive, metastatic, recurrent or progressive PCa concluded it was not possible to makea recommendation on when to start hormonal therapy in advanced asymptomatic PCa. The ESMOguidelines do not make any statement .</rdfs:isDefinedBy>

        <rdfs:isDefinedBy>The term &quot;&quot;vitamin K&quot;&quot; refers to a group of chemically similar fat-soluble compounds called naphthoquinones: vitamin K1 (phytonadione) is found in plants and is the primary source of vitamin K for humans through dietary consumption, vitamin K2 compounds (menaquinones) are made by bacteria in the human gut, and vitamin K3 (menadione) is a water-soluble preparation available for adults only. Vitamin K is necessary for the liver to produce the coagulation factors II, VII, IX, and X, as well as the clotting factors protein C, protein S, and protein Z; vitamin K deficiency can result in deficiencies of these coagulation factors and excess bleeding. An injection of vitamin K is routinely given to newborn infants to prevent vitamin K deficiency bleeding, also known as hemorrhagic disease of the newborn. Vitamin K deficiency is rare in adults but may result from chronic malnutrition or an inability to absorb dietary vitamins.
CRCH Definition: Fat soluble vitamin that is a coenzyme during the synthesis of the biologically active form of a number of proteins involved in blood coagulation and bone metabolism. Vitamin K&apos;s structure typically consists of a methylated naphthoquinone ring from which one or more unsaturated aliphatic side chains are attached at the 3-position of the ring.
NCI-GLOSS Definition: A nutrient that the body needs in small amounts to function and stay healthy. Vitamin K helps to form blood clots (a mass that forms when blood platelets, proteins, and cells stick together) and maintain strong bones. It is fat-soluble (can dissolve in fats and oils) and is found in green leafy vegetables, broccoli, liver, and vegetable oils. Vitamin K is also made by bacteria that live in the large intestine. Not enough vitamin K can lead to bleeding and bruising.&quot;</rdfs:isDefinedBy>

        <rdfs:isDefinedBy>A synthetic nonapeptide analogue of gonadotropin-releasing hormone. Leuprolide binds to and activates gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptors. Continuous, prolonged administration of leuprolide in males results in pituitary GnRH receptor desensitization and inhibition of pituitary secretion of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH), leading to a significant decline in testosterone production; in females, prolonged administration results in a decrease in estradiol production. This agent reduces testosterone production to castration levels and may inhibit androgen receptor-positive tumor progression./NCI-GLOSS Definition: The active ingredient in a drug used to treat symptoms of advanced prostate cancer. It is also used to treat early puberty in children and certain gynecologic conditions. It is being studied in the treatment of other conditions and types of cancer. Leuprolide blocks the body from making testosterone (a male hormone) and estradiol (a female hormone). It may stop the growth of prostate cancer cells that need testosterone to grow. It is a type of gonadotropin-releasing hormone analog.</rdfs:isDefinedBy>

        <rdfs:isDefinedBy>In patients with biochemical failure after radiation therapy, the biopsy status is a major predictor of outcome,provided the biopsies are obtained 18-24 months after treatment. Given the morbidity of local salvage options,it is thus necessary to obtain histological proof of the local recurrence before treating the patient .TRUS is not reliable in depicting local recurrences after radiation therapy. In contrast, mpMRI has yielded excellent results  and can be used for biopsy targeting and guiding local salvage treatment.Detection of recurrent cancer is also feasible with Choline and Acetate PET/CT, but PET/CT has poorer spatial resolution than MRI.</rdfs:isDefinedBy>

        <rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource="&ProstateCancer;Assessment_of_local_recurrences"/>
        <rdfs:isDefinedBy>The precise localisation of the local recurrence by imaging techniques is needed only if histological proof of the recurrence is mandatory before salvage treatment and/or if this localisation could change treatment planning. Transrectal ultrasound is neither sensitive nor specific in detecting local recurrences after RP. Even with TRUS guidance, the sensitivity of anastomotic biopsies remains low: 40-71% for PSA levels &gt; 1 ng/mL and 14-45% for PSA levels &lt; 1 ng/mL. As a consequence, salvage radiation therapy is usually decided on the basis of the BCR, without histological proof of the local recurrence. The dose delivered to the prostatic bed also tends to be uniform as it has not been demonstrated that a focal dose escalation at the site of recurrence improves the outcome. Thus, most patients undergo salvage radiation therapy without local imaging. Nonetheless, several studies have reported promising results in the detection of local recurrences using MRI, particularly dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI which showed sensitivities and specificities of 84-88% and 89-100%, respectively. However, the mean PSA level in these studies was 0.8-1.9 ng/mL, which is higher than the 0.5 ng/mL threshold usually used for salvage therapy. Recently, two studies evaluated mpMRI in patients with PSA level &lt; 0.5 ng/mL. One found a sensitivity of only 13% in men with PSA level &lt; 0.3 ng/mL , while the other reported a sensitivity of 86% in patients with PSA level &lt; 0.4 ng/mL. Thus, it remains to be defined whether MRI is able to correctly detect local recurrences in patients with PSA level &lt; 0.5 ng/mL in order to allow a stereotaxic boost to the recurrence site during salvage radiation therapy. Choline or Acetate PET/CT can also detect local recurrences, but are less sensitive than MRI.</rdfs:isDefinedBy>

The different products have practical differences that need to be considered in everyday practice, including the storage temperature, whether a drug is ready for immediate use or requires reconstitution, and whether a drug is given by subcutaneous or intramuscular injection.</rdfs:isDefinedBy>

        <rdfs:isDefinedBy>The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the immunoglobulin binding factor family. It is synthesized by the epithelial cells of the prostate gland and secreted into the seminal plasma. This protein has inhibin-like activity. It may have a role as an autocrine paracrine factor in uterine, breast and other female reproductive tissues. The expression of the encoded protein is found to be decreased in prostate cancer. Two alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms are described for this gene. The use of alternate polyadenylation sites has been found for this gene.

        <rdfs:isDefinedBy>This gene encodes the class A macrophage scavenger receptors, which include three different types (1, 2, 3) generated by alternative splicing of this gene. These receptors or isoforms are macrophage-specific trimeric integral membrane glycoproteins and have been implicated in many macrophage-associated physiological and pathological processes including atherosclerosis, Alzheimer&apos;s disease, and host defense. The isoforms type 1 and type 2 are functional receptors and are able to mediate the endocytosis of modified low density lipoproteins (LDLs). The isoform type 3 does not internalize modified LDL (acetyl-LDL) despite having the domain shown to mediate this function in the types 1 and 2 isoforms. It has an altered intracellular processing and is trapped within the endoplasmic reticulum, making it unable to perform endocytosis. The isoform type 3 can inhibit the function of isoforms type 1 and type 2 when co-expressed, indicating a dominant negative effect and suggesting a mechanism for regulation of scavenger receptor activity in macrophages.

The protein encoded by this gene is a transcriptional repressor thought to negatively regulate MYC function, and is therefore a potential tumor suppressor. This protein inhibits the transcriptional activity of MYC by competing for MAX, another basic helix-loop-helix protein that binds to MYC and is required for its function. Defects in this gene are frequently found in patients with prostate tumors. Three alternatively spliced transcripts encoding different isoforms have been described. Additional alternatively spliced transcripts may exist but the products of these transcripts have not been verified experimentally. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]</rdfs:isDefinedBy>

        <rdfs:isDefinedBy>The acetate salt form of megestrol, a synthetic derivative of the naturally occurring female sex hormone progesterone with potential anti-estrogenic and antineoplastic activity. Mimicking the action of progesterone, megestrol acetate binds to and activates nuclear progesterone receptors in the reproductive system, and causes the ligand-receptor complex to be translocated to the nucleus where it binds to and promotes expression of target genes. This leads to an alteration in protein synthesis, which modulates cell growth of reproductive tissues. Due to the negative feedback mechanism seen with progesterone, megestrol also blocks luteinizing hormone (LH) release from the pituitary gland, thereby leading to an inhibition of ovulation and an alteration in the cervical mucus and endometrium. Furthermore, without stimulation of LH, estrogen release from the ovaries is stopped, hence impedes the growth of estrogen-sensitive tumor cells./NCI-GLOSS Definition: A drug used to block estrogen and suppress the effects of estrogen and androgens. It is used to treat breast and endometrial cancer, and is being studied in the treatment of other types of cancer. It is also used to improve appetite in patients with cancer.

        <rdfs:isDefinedBy>Neoadjuvant hormonal therapy (NHT) is defined as therapy given before definitive local curative treatment.|Since PCa is an androgen-dependent tumour, NHT is an appealing concept. A recent review and meta-analysis|studied the role of NHT and prostatectomy. NHT significantly reduced positive margin rates (RR = 0.49|p &lt; 0.00001), extra-prostatic extension (RR = 1.63; p &lt; 0.0001) and lymph node invasion (RR = 0.49; 0.42-0.56;|p &lt; 0.02). However, this was not associated with improved OS or disease-free survival (DFS).|Regarding adjuvant HT, a Cochrane review has been published: the pooled data showed a|non-significant 5-year OS benefit (OR: 1.50 [95% CI: 0.79-2.84]) and no 10-year OS benefit (with again a trend|favouring the adjuvant approach). The pooled data for DFS gave an overall OR of 3.73 (95% CI: 2.3-6.03). The|overall effect estimate was highly significant (p &lt; 0.00001) in favour of the HT arm. The Early Prostate Cancer|Trialists’ Group (EPC) trial using bicalutamide 150 mg daily could not be included in the Cochrane review|due to missing information. After a median follow-up of 7.2 years, there was a significant improvement in|objective PFS that was only significant in the locally advanced disease group (HR: 0.75; 95% CI: 0.61-0.91).|There was an OS decrease trend in the localised disease group (HR: 1.16; 95% CI: 0.99-1.37). No OS benefit|was observed in both localised and locally advanced groups.|The main limitations of the above data are the mixing of pN0 and pN1 populations. For pN+ patients, 2 RCT are|available and drive the main conclusion of the Cochrane review, even if non RCT suggest that the benefit might|not be so large in all patients. Regarding pN0 / N0 stages, the only RCT is the EPC project. Using|more conventional HT, a large retrospective data base with a median follow up of 10 years suggests that|adjuvant HT might be linked to an increased specific, but not OS benefit.</rdfs:isDefinedBy>

        <rdfs:isDefinedBy>Due to increased bone turnover and decreased BMD in a time-dependent manner, ADT use is linked to an increased risk of fracture (up to 45% relative risk with long-term ADT). Hip fractures in men are associated with a significant risk of death. A precise evaluation of BMD should be performed by dual emission X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) before starting long-term ADT. An initial low BMD (T-score &lt; -2.5 or &lt; -1, with other risk factors) indicates a high risk of subsequent non-metastatic fracture. The WHO FRAX tool (http://www.shef.ac.uk/FRAX) should be used to evaluate individual risk. Obesity (increase in body fat mass by up to 10%) and sarcopenia (decrease in lean tissue mass by up to 3%) are common and occur during the first year of ADT. Both changes increase the fracture risk.</rdfs:isDefinedBy>

        <rdfs:isDefinedBy>The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the PP2C family of Ser/Thr protein phosphatases. PP2C family members are known to be negative regulators of cell stress response pathways. The expression of this gene is induced in a p53-dependent manner in response to various environmental stresses. While being induced by tumor suppressor protein TP53/p53, this phosphatase negatively regulates the activity of p38 MAP kinase, MAPK/p38, through which it reduces the phosphorylation of p53, and in turn suppresses p53-mediated transcription and apoptosis. This phosphatase thus mediates a feedback regulation of p38-p53 signaling that contributes to growth inhibition and the suppression of stress induced apoptosis. This gene is located in a chromosomal region known to be amplified in breast cancer. The amplification of this gene has been detected in both breast cancer cell line and primary breast tumors, which suggests a role of this gene in cancer development.

        <rdfs:isDefinedBy>This gene was identified as a tumor suppressor that is mutated in a large number of cancers at high frequency. The protein encoded by this gene is a phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate 3-phosphatase. It contains a tensin like domain as well as a catalytic domain similar to that of the dual specificity protein tyrosine phosphatases. Unlike most of the protein tyrosine phosphatases, this protein preferentially dephosphorylates phosphoinositide substrates. It negatively regulates intracellular levels of phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate in cells and functions as a tumor suppressor by negatively regulating AKT/PKB signaling pathway. The use of a non-canonical (CUG) upstream initiation site produces a longer isoform that initiates translation with a leucine, and is thought to be preferentially associated with the mitochondrial inner membrane. This longer isoform may help regulate energy metabolism in the mitochondria. A pseudogene of this gene is found on chromosome 9. Alternative splicing and the use of multiple translation start codons results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms. [provided by RefSeq, Feb 2015]</rdfs:isDefinedBy>

A high-risk subgroup with elevated risk of metastases and PCSM are those patients with a PSA-DT &lt; 3 months, time to biochemical progression &lt; 3 years, biopsy Gleason score 8-10 and clinical stage cT3b-T4. Conversely, patients at low risk of metastases and PCSM are those with a PSA-DT &gt; 15 months, biopsy Gleason score &lt; 7, clinical stage &lt; cT3a and time to biochemical progression&gt; 3 years. Zumsteg et al. have designed a risk score to further subdivide patients who develop PSA recurrence following RT. Those with either 0, 1 or &gt; 2 high-risk factors (PSA-DT &lt; 3 months, time to biochemical progression &lt; 3 years, biopsy Gleason score 8-10 and clinical stage cT3b-T4) have an increased risk of developing metastases and PCSM.Again, the choice of local salvage treatment (salvage RP, salvage cryo, salvage HIFU, salvage brachytherapy)should be guided by the life expectancy and oncological risk profile of each patient, together with the patient’s expectations.</rdfs:isDefinedBy>

        <rdfs:isDefinedBy>Increased life expectancy in PCa makes post-treatment QoL a key issue. Health-related QoL (HRQoL) refers to the impact of disease and treatment on well-being and physical, emotional and social functioning, including daily functioning. HRQoL is rated by patients, and is important because physicians often underestimate the impact of disease and treatment on patients. PCa-specific HRQoL refers to the disease-specific outcome of PCa, including urinary, bowel and sexual functioning. General HRQoL refers to well-being, vitality, fatigue, pain, general health status, global QoL, and life satisfaction. HRQoL is measured using standardised questionnaires, which provide an objective assessment of general and disease-specific domains. Comparison of the most common contemporary therapies for localised PCa is necessary to inform patients about treatment options and address patient preferences for the various possible outcomes. There is still limited objective data about HRQoL in PCa treatment.</rdfs:isDefinedBy>

        <rdfs:isDefinedBy>The optimal thresholds at which ADT must be stopped or resumed are empirical. Nevertheless, several points are clear.
• IAD is based on intermittent castration. Therefore, only drugs leading to castration are suitable for use in IAD.
• Most published experiences are based on CAB, which is considered as standard treatment. An LHRH antagonist might be a valid alternative, without any significant benefits.
• The induction cycle must last 9 months at the most, otherwise testosterone recovery is unlikely.
• The treatment is stopped only if patients have fulfilled all the following criteria:
- well-informed and compliant patient;
- no clinical progression;
- clear PSA response, empirically defined as a PSA &lt; 4 ng/mL in metastatic disease.
• Strict follow-up is mandatory, with clinical examination every 3-6 months. The more advanced the disease, the closer the follow-up. The same laboratory should be used to measure the PSA level.
• Treatment is resumed when the patient reaches either a clinical progression, or a PSA above a predetermined, empirically fixed, threshold: usually 10-20 ng/mL in metastatic cases.
• The same treatment is used for at least 3-6 months.
• Subsequent cycles of treatment are based on the same rules until the first sign is seen of a castrateresistant
status.
• The best population for IAD has still to be fully characterised. However, the most important factor seems to be the patient’s response to the first cycle of IAD, e.g. the PSA level response.IAD might be an option in metastatic situations after a standardised induction period, even if the benefits are fewer compared to those with less advanced situations.</rdfs:isDefinedBy>

        <rdfs:isDefinedBy>One of the most common malignant tumors afflicting men. The majority of carcinomas arise in the peripheral zone and a minority occur in the central or the transitional zone of the prostate gland. Grossly, prostatic carcinomas appear as ill-defined yellow areas of discoloration in the prostate gland lobes. Adenocarcinomas represent the overwhelming majority of prostatic carcinomas. Prostatic-specific antigen (PSA) serum test is widely used as a screening test for the early detection of prostatic carcinoma. Treatment options include radical prostatectomy, radiation therapy, androgen ablation and cryotherapy. Watchful waiting or surveillance alone is an option for older patients with low-grade or low-stage disease. -- 2002</rdfs:isDefinedBy>

        <rdfs:isDefinedBy>In theory, proton beams are an attractive alternative to photon-beam radiotherapy for PCa, as they|deposit almost all their radiation dose at the end of the particle’s path in tissue (the Bragg peak), in contrast to|photons, which deposit radiation along their path. There is also a very sharp fall-off for proton beams beyond|their deposition depth, meaning that critical normal tissues beyond this depth could be effectively spared. In|contrast, photon beams continue to deposit energy until they leave the body, including an exit dose.|Two recent planning studies comparing conformal proton therapy with IMRT have yielded|conflicting results; one study suggested that the two are equivalent in terms of rectal dose sparing, but that|IMRT is actually superior in terms of bladder sparing; the other study suggested a clearer advantage for|protons.|One randomised trial on dose escalation (70.2 vs. 79.2 Gy) has incorporated protons for the boost|doses of either 19.8 or 28.8 Gy. This trial shows improved outcome with the higher dose, but it cannot be used|as evidence for the superiority of proton therapy per se. Thus, unequivocal information that shows an|advantage of protons over IMRT photon therapy is still not available.|Studies from the SEER database, and from Harvard, describing toxicity and patient|reported outcomes, respectively, do not point to an inherent superiority for protons - indeed, in terms of longer|term GI toxicity, proton therapy might even be inferior to IMRT.|A retrospective 2:1 matched-control analysis of 27,647 US Medicare patients compared 314|men receiving proton therapy with 628 men who had IMRT. Despite the considerably higher costs for proton|therapy, there was some improvement in GU-tract toxicity after 6 months, but not after 12 months, and not at|the GI tract.|A randomised trial comparing equivalent doses of proton-beam therapy with IMRT is needed|to compare the efficacy of protons vs. photons; a study of this type is under consideration by the RTOG.|Meanwhile, proton therapy must be regarded as a promising, but experimental, alternative to photon-beam|therapy.</rdfs:isDefinedBy>

        <rdfs:isDefinedBy>The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the RAD51 protein family. RAD51 family members are highly similar to bacterial RecA and Saccharomyces cerevisiae Rad51, and are known to be involved in the homologous recombination and repair of DNA. This protein can interact with the ssDNA-binding protein RPA and RAD52, and it is thought to play roles in homologous pairing and strand transfer of DNA. This protein is also found to interact with BRCA1 and BRCA2, which may be important for the cellular response to DNA damage. BRCA2 is shown to regulate both the intracellular localization and DNA-binding ability of this protein. Loss of these controls following BRCA2 inactivation may be a key event leading to genomic instability and tumorigenesis. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Aug 2009]</rdfs:isDefinedBy>

Risk factors for acute or late gastrointestinal toxicities after RT include advanced age, preexisting diabetes mellitus,haemorrhoids, inflammatory bowel disease, a history of prior abdominal surgery, larger rectal volume and the concomitant use of androgen deprivation. Pre-treatment genitourinary complaints, prior transurethral resection of the prostate and the presence of acute genitourinary toxicity are suggested as contributing to long-term urinary morbidity.</rdfs:isDefinedBy>

        <rdfs:isDefinedBy>Information on rice consumption was first assessed in 1980 in NHS participants using a validated semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire (SFFQ), and repeated in 1984, 1986, and every 4 years thereafter. Similar SFFQs were administered every 4 years for NHS II participants during 1991 through 2009 and for HPFS participants during 1986 through 2008. In each SFFQ, we asked the participants how often, on average over the past year, they consumed a specified portion size of each food, with nine possible frequency choices ranging from “almost never” to “6 or more times per day”. For white rice and brown rice, we used 1 cup as the serving unit. The total rice intake was calculated as the sum of white rice and brown rice. In the current study, we categorized participants’ rice intake into 4 categories (&lt; 1 serving per week, 1 serving per week, 2-4 servings per week and ≥ 5 servings per week). The reproducibility and validity of these SFFQs have been evaluated in detail elsewhere16-19. Assessments of white rice and brown rice consumption were moderately correlated with diet record assessments. For example, the corrected Pearson correlation coefficients between these 2 assessments were 0.53 for white rice and 0.41 for brown rice in the HPFS </rdfs:isDefinedBy>

This gene is imprinted, with preferential expression from the maternal allele. Mutations in this gene have been found in Wilms&apos; tumor and lung cancer. This protein may act as a transporter of organic cations, and have a role in the transport of chloroquine and quinidine-related compounds in kidney. Several alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been described. [provided by RefSeq, Oct 2015]</rdfs:isDefinedBy>

        <rdfs:isDefinedBy>Following local recurrence after previous definitive RT there is no indication for external beam salvage RT as the total dose is limited and therefore the chance of cure is low. For carefully selected patients with primary localised PCa and histologically proven local recurrence, high- or low-dose rate (H/LDR) brachytherapy remain effective treatment options with an acceptable toxicity profile. However, the published series are relatively small, therefore this treatment should be offered in experienced centres only. Fifty-two patients were treated at the Scripps Clinic with HDR-brachytherapy over a period of nine years. With a median followup of 60 months the 5-year biochemical control was 51% and only 2% grade 3 GU toxicities were reported.Comparable with these data, 42 patients were treated in a phase-II-trial at MSCCC in New York. Ofnote, the median pre-treatment dose was 81 Gy given with IMRT and the prescription HDR-dose of 32 Gy was delivered in four fractions over 30 hours. The biochemical relapse-free survival after 5 years was 69%(median follow-up 36 months). Grade 2 late side effects were seen in 15% and one patient developed Grade 3 incontinence. However, older data with higher rates of side effects have been reported.</rdfs:isDefinedBy>

        <rdfs:isDefinedBy> A nonmetallic chemical element found in trace amounts in human body. Selenium primarily occurs in vivo as selenocompounds, mostly selenoproteins such as glutathione peroxidase and thioredoxin reductase (enzymes responsible for detoxification). Alone or in combination with Vitamin E, selenocompounds act as antioxidants. These agents scavenge free radicals; prevent blood clots by inhibiting platelet aggregation; strengthen the immune system; and have been shown, in some instances, to inhibit chromosomal damage and mutations. Exhibiting chemopreventive activity, selenocompounds also inhibit the induction of protein kinase C.
NCI-GLOSS Definition: A mineral that is needed by the body to stay healthy. It is being studied in the prevention and treatment of some types of cancer. Selenium is a type of antioxidant.&quot;</rdfs:isDefinedBy>

        <rdfs:isDefinedBy>A naturally-occurring phytochemical belonging to the class of isothiocyanates. As the aglycone metabolite of glucosinolate glucoraphanin (sulforaphane glucosinolate), sulforaphane acts as an antioxidant and potent stimulator of endogenous detoxifying enzymes. This agent displays anticarcinogenic properties due to its ability to induce phase II detoxification enzymes, such as glutathione S-transferase and quinone reductase, thereby providing protection against certain carcinogens and toxic, reactive oxygen species. Broccoli sprouts contain large amounts of sulforaphane, which is also found in other cruciferous vegetables including cabbage and kale. (NCI04)</rdfs:isDefinedBy>

        <rdfs:isDefinedBy>This gene encodes a tumor suppressor protein containing transcriptional activation, DNA binding, and oligomerization domains. The encoded protein responds to diverse cellular stresses to regulate expression of target genes, thereby inducing cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, senescence, DNA repair, or changes in metabolism. Mutations in this gene are associated with a variety of human cancers, including hereditary cancers such as Li-Fraumeni syndrome. Alternative splicing of this gene and the use of alternate promoters result in multiple transcript variants and isoforms. Additional isoforms have also been shown to result from the use of alternate translation initiation codons from identical transcript variants (PMIDs: 12032546, 20937277).

The gene product contains a coiled-coil domain that interacts with stathmin, a cytosolic phosphoprotein implicated in tumorigenesis.

In vitro steady-state expression of this tumor susceptibility gene appears to be important for maintenance of genomic stability and cell cycle regulation. Mutations and alternative splicing in this gene occur in high frequency in breast cancer and suggest that defects occur during breast cancer tumorigenesis and/or progression.

        <rdfs:isDefinedBy>&quot;Primary curative procedures such as RP, and RT are well-established therapeutic options in the management of localised PCa. Despite technical improvements, there is still a significant risk of cancer recurrence after therapy. Between 27% and 53% of all patients undergoing RP or RT develop PSA-recurrence. While a rising PSA level universally antedates metastatic progression and prostate-cancer-specific mortality (PCSM), physicians must inform the patient that the natural history of PSA-only recurrence may be prolonged and that a PSA rise is not a surrogate for these survival endpoints. Physicians treating patients with
PSA-only recurrence face a difficult set of decisions in attempting to delay the onset of metastatic disease and death while avoiding over-treating patients whose disease may never affect their OS or QoL. It has to be emphasised that the treatment recommendations for these patients should be given after discussion with a multidisciplinary team.&quot;</rdfs:isDefinedBy>

CRCH Definition: A class of micronutrients that regulate and support chemical reactions in the body.
NCI-GLOSS Definition: A nutrient that the body needs in small amounts to function and stay healthy. Sources of vitamins are plant and animal food products and dietary supplements. Some vitamins are made in the human body from food products. Vitamins are either fat-soluble (can dissolve in fats and oils) or water-soluble (can dissolve in water). Excess fat-soluble vitamins are stored in the body&apos;s fatty tissue, but excess water-soluble vitamins are removed in the urine. Examples are vitamin A, vitamin C, and vitamin E.&quot;</rdfs:isDefinedBy>

This agent reduces testosterone production to castration levels and may inhibit androgen receptor-positive tumor progression./NCI-GLOSS Definition: The active ingredient in a drug used to treat symptoms of advanced prostate cancer. It is also used to treat early puberty in children and certain gynecologic conditions. It is being studied in the treatment of other conditions and types of cancer.

The largest RCT in 1,286 M1b patients found no difference between surgical castration plus flutamide compared to surgical castration without flutamide. Systematic reviews have shown that CAB using non-steroidal anti-androgen (NSAA) appears to provide a small survival advantage (&lt; 5%) vs. monotherapy (surgical castration or LHRH agonists) beyond 5 years. However, some of the larger trials included in these reviews were methodologically flawed and it is unlikely that this small advantage, if any, is useful in daily clinical practice. LHRH analogues and NSAA have the highest estimated quality-adjusted survival. However, the use of CAB increases side effects and the economic cost. There is an incremental cost of more than US$1 million per quality-adjusted life-year vs. orchiectomy alone.</rdfs:isDefinedBy>

It has been suggested that stopping castration prior to progression would mean that any subsequent tumour growth would be solely sustained by the proliferation of androgendependent stem cells. The stem cells should therefore be susceptible once again to androgen withdrawal. Thus, IAD could delay the emergence of the androgen-independent clone. This rationale has been developed mainly through models (e.g. the Shionoggi breast model), which may be significantly different to tumour behaviour in men. Other possible benefits of IAD include the preservation of QoL in off-treatment periods and a reduction in treatment cost. IAD is feasible and accepted by patients. Two independent reviews summarised the clinical efficacy of this attitude. They were based on seven RCTs. Of the seven trials, only three trials were in patients with M1 disease. The three remaining trials were combinations of different relapse situations, mainly locally advanced and metastatic cases. The design of the seven trials is summarised in Table 6.6.1, while the main results for survival are summarised in Table 6.6.2. The most important survival finding was the lack of a significant difference in OS between continuous and intermittent ADT. Table 6.6.3 summarises the expected treatment benefits of IAD. The most important finding was that the benefit in overall QoL was at best minimal if any. However, some treatment side effects were decreased using IAD.</rdfs:isDefinedBy>

        <rdfs:isDefinedBy>During castration, the occurrence of castration-resistant status (CRPC) is systematic. It is thought that it is mediated through two main overlapping mechanisms, which are androgen-receptor (AR)-independent and AR-dependent (see Section 6.11 - Castrate-resistant Prostate Cancer). In CRPC, the intracellular androgen level is increased compared to androgen sensitive cells, and an over-expression of the AR has been observed in CRPC, suggesting an adaptative mechanism. This has led to the development of two new major compounds targeting the androgen axis: abiraterone acetate and enzalutamide.</rdfs:isDefinedBy>
