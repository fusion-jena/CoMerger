# OWL Restriction Reconciliation Repository

This is a repository about the OWL restriction reconciliation in merging ontologies. 
We proposed (i) one type conflicts by building a subsumption hierarchy on datatypes and performing substitution or instantiation on them, (ii) cardinality restriction conflicts with least upper and greatest lower bound method, (iii) value restriction conflicts by utilizing the semantic relatedness. 

This repository contains the detection and resolution table and also the case study result.

The proposed method by Elena Grygorova, Samira Babalou, and Birgitta KÃ¶nig-Ries is under review of ESWC2020 in Poster and Demo track.
